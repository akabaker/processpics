Processpics.py

This script borrows heavily from the pyinotify asyncnotifier example. Inotify is
used to monitor IN_CREATE events in a target directory used for eye-fi card
uploades. The uploaded images are processed by SimpleCV. The colorDistance from
SimpleCV.Color.WHITE is applied to the uploaded image.
